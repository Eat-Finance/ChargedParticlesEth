**Charged Particles** are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that are minted with **DAI** and accrue interest via **CHAI** giving the Token a "Charge". Charged Particles can be "discharged" at any time by the owner, collecting the interest from the token. They can also be burned to reclaim the underlying DAI + interest in full, destroying the token.

Based on the amount of "charge" a token has, Smart Contracts and/or Dapps can decide how to handle the token - custom mechanics can be designed around the level of "Charge" a token has.

Imagine an NFT that represents a Sword - the power of that sword could be dependant on the amount of "Charge" the token has. Or perhaps certain items can only be used once they reach a certain level of charge.

Other possibilities include battling over the "charge" of a particle - the winner earns the interest from their competitor's particles.


Charged Particles come in 2 flavours: **ERC-721** & **ERC-1155**
